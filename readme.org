You've just received this project, which is a 1 file app, but it's not
even dockerized.


To prepare for CI/CD, and be ready to fix bugs:

- Dockerize this project
- Write a docker-compose to be able to run it

- The 2 endpoints that have to run are =/=  and =`/db_test`.
  The rest is still WIP.

- If there are side tasks you could take that have advantages for
  other cases you can mention them

- What are the next immediate things you'd add?

- Any mid term features you would add CI/CD wise to make your/devs life easier?
